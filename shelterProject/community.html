            We recognize the need for conceptualization outside the limits of the shelter. For our project to be successful, it is our belief that their deployment into dense populations using multiple shelters needs to be designed. In addition, consideration should be given to the durability of the shelter, provisions for infrastructure development over time, and the employment of strategies for expansion as affected populations transition from the rebuilding phase into permanent communities. The design can be customized based on site requirements and restrictions.</p>

            Shelter is critical to long term stability… and shelter is a basic human right. It provides dignity, safety, protection, and a sense of awareness – giving individuals an identifiable place to live their lives from. Without shelter, these characteristics of human habitation do not exist, which results in behavioral disorders, psychological trauma, and a general disconnection from the rest of society. Although shelter is not necessarily life-saving, it is certainly life-affirming, giving persons a platform from which they can begin the process of rebuilding their lives.</p>

        <img src="images/community/03.jpg" alt="landscape" ><p>
The same can be said for living within a community. Individuals in affected regions post-disaster can benefit from others in similar circumstances for shared resources, protection and safety, shared information, and aid acquisition. The ability of a group of individuals to act as one unit provides improved living conditions for the collective.

        </p>

Issues of safety and health concerns in the wake of disasters are well documented. The organization of tent camps and shelters begins in the critical weeks and months after a disaster. The success or failure of this organization typically shape the future outlook of an affected region, and can be projected to define the outcome of rebuilding. Should the situation with shelter be handled deliberately, with skill and acumen, and in a method that provides human dignity and identity, then it could be assumed that the rebuilding process will succeed on many levels. Should shelter be provided in haphazard fashion, over-populated, with significant shelter shortages after the 6-month period, then issues of crime, disease, spikes in the rate of pregnancy, and a general malaise begin to take hold in the affected areas.

        </p><img src="images/community/01.jpg" alt="landscape" ><p>
Our proposal is to organize the communities in groups of 4, 6 or 8 shelters at a time – a situation where persons using the shelters will become commonly aware of a smaller group of individuals, therefore creating a sense of “tribe” or commonality that will bolster a defense against acts of violence or theft. The shelters organize around a small central courtyard functioning as an outdoor “kitchen” area in the weeks and months immediately after the disaster until infrastructure can be put in place to support cooking inside the shelters.

        </p><img src="images/community/05.jpg" alt="landscape" ><p>
Public restrooms and showers are also accommodated in the layout of the community, with direct access to main thoroughfares for transportation vehicles to conduct daily maintenance.  Such avenues become the veins of rehabilitation – with supplies and critical support capable of delivery, and as a source for transportation as individuals move about to find the needs of their communities.

</p>
<p>With the courtyard schemes laying out shelters in dense groupings, pedestrian pathways in between communities allow for a market economy to take hold – a place for bartering or selling goods. Communities can grow to be self supporting modalities in time. Therefore, a working neighborhood develops with groups of 4 to 8 communities – some 20 to 40 shelters, with shared bathing and restroom facilities, and a working trade market. We estimate populations of 80 to 200 persons functioning in a neighborhood before the infrastructure is taxed.</p>

        <img src="images/community/07.jpg" alt="landscape" ><p>
This layout provides extreme benefits to the rebuilding effort. Over time communities can grow, break down, mutate and evolve into permanent dwellings based on ownership and family size. The units themselves have some expansion possibilities. Other options include acquiring multiple shelters to house a family compound. As the months and years stabilize conditions, the land can be purchased, and these shelters can be retrofitted with utilities, permanent finishes, and landscaping.

Neighborhoods eventually begin to take shape that recognize a troubled past, but look forward to a stable future. </p>
